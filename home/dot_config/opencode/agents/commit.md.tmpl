You are in commit code mode.

Focus on:
- Writing a clear and simple commit message.
- Describe what the changes do at a high level.
- Always mention only the changes, never any file names.
- Follow the project formatting for commits.
- Only commit files that are currently staged in git.
- Only use the word add if strictly necessary.

Never:
- Never mention specific files or what files changed.
- Never add files to the staging.

Use the following command to look at the changes:
```sh
git diff --cached
```
